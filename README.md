# LatticeGaugeNeuralNetworks
Some introductory exercises on Normalizing Flow applied to multimodal distributions. 
We hope to be able to apply asap some results to Gauge Theories and QCD (still faaaar away)
The generation of Gaussian Mixture multimodal PDF and the training of the model through the Normalizing Flow, using PyTorch, is in normflow directory:  
-Generating initial data: [normflow/module/multimodal.py](https://github.com/GennaroCalandriello/LatticeGaugeNeuralNetworks/blob/main/normflow/module/multimodal.py)  
-Training and running the model: [normflow/Flowbased.py](https://github.com/GennaroCalandriello/LatticeGaugeNeuralNetworks/blob/main/normflow/FlowBased.py)
